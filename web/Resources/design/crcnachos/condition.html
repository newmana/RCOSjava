    <TD VALIGN=TOP>
 The following class defines a "condition variable".  A condition
 variable does not have a value, but threads may be queued, waiting
 on the variable.  These are only operations on a condition variable:
<P>
      Wait() -- release the lock, relinquish the CPU until signaled,
              then re-acquire the lock
<P>
      Signal() -- wake up a thread, if there are any waiting on
              the condition
<P>
      Broadcast() -- wake up all threads waiting on the condition
<P>
 All operations on a condition variable must be made while
 the current thread has acquired a lock.  Indeed, all accesses
 to a given condition variable must be protected by the same lock.
 In other words, mutual exclusion must be enforced among threads calling
 the condition variable operations.
<P>
 In Nachos, condition variables are assumed to obey *Mesa*-style
 semantics.  When a Signal or Broadcast wakes up another thread,
 it simply puts the thread on the ready list, and it is the responsibility
 of the woken thread to re-acquire the lock (this re-acquire is
 taken care of within Wait()).  By contrast, some define condition
 variables according to *Hoare*-style semantics -- where the signalling
 thread gives up control over the lock and the CPU to the woken thread,
 which runs immediately and gives back control over the lock to the
 signaller when the woken thread leaves the critical section.
<P>
 The consequence of using Mesa-style semantics is that some other thread
 can acquire the lock, and change data structures, before the woken
 thread gets a chance to run.
