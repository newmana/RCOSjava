    <TD VALIGN=TOP>
      Data structures to represent the Nachos file system.
<P>
      A file system is a set of files stored on disk, organized
      into directories.  Operations on the file system have to
      do with "naming" -- creating, opening, and deleting files,
      given a textual file name.  Operations on an individual
      "open" file (read, write, close) are to be found in the OpenFile
      class (openfile.h).
<P>
      We define two separate implementations of the file system.
      The "STUB" version just re-defines the Nachos file system
      operations as operations on the native UNIX file system on the machine
      running the Nachos simulation.  This is provided in case the
      multiprogramming and virtual memory assignments (which make use
      of the file system) are done before the file system assignment.
<P>
      The other version is a "real" file system, built on top of
      a disk simulator.  The disk is simulated using the native UNIX
      file system (in a file named "DISK").
<P>
      In the "real" implementation, there are two key data structures used
      in the file system.  There is a single "root" directory, listing
      all of the files in the file system; unlike UNIX, the baseline
      system does not provide a hierarchical directory structure.
      In addition, there is a bitmap for allocating
      disk sectors.  Both the root directory and the bitmap are themselves
      stored as files in the Nachos file system -- this causes an interesting
      bootstrap problem when the simulated disk is initialized.
