    <TD VALIGN=TOP>
      Data structures for managing threads.  A thread represents
      sequential execution of code within a program.
      So the state of a thread includes the program counter,
      the processor registers, and the execution stack.
<P>
      Note that because we allocate a fixed size stack for each
      thread, it is possible to overflow the stack -- for instance,
      by recursing to too deep a level.  The most common reason
      for this occuring is allocating large data structures
      on the stack.  For instance, this will cause problems:
      <PRE>
              void foo() { int buf[1000]; ...}
      </PRE>
      Instead, you should allocate all data structures dynamically:
<PRE>
              void foo() { int *buf = new int[1000]; ...}
</PRE>
      Bad things happen if you overflow the stack, and in the worst
      case, the problem may not be caught explicitly.  Instead,
      the only symptom may be bizarre segmentation faults.  (Of course,
      other problems can cause seg faults, so that isn't a sure sign
      that your thread stacks are too small.)
<P>
      One thing to try if you find yourself with seg faults is to
      increase the size of thread stack -- ThreadStackSize.

<P>
      In this interface, forking a thread takes two steps.
      We must first allocate a data structure for it: "t = new Thread".
      Only then can we do the fork: "t->fork(f, arg)".
<P>
 The following class defines a "thread control block" -- which
 represents a single thread of execution.
<P>
  Every thread has:
  <UL>
     <LI> an execution stack for activation records ("stackTop" and "stack")
     <LI> space to save CPU registers while not running ("machineState")
     <LI> a "status" (running/ready/blocked)
  </UL>
<P>
  Some threads also belong to a user address space; threads
  that only run in the kernel have a NULL address space.
