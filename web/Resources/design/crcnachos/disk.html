    <TD VALIGN=TOP>
 The following class defines a physical disk I/O device.  The disk
 has a single surface, split up into "tracks", and each track split
 up into "sectors" (the same number of sectors on each track, and each
 sector has the same number of bytes of storage).
<P>
 Addressing is by sector number -- each sector on the disk is given
 a unique number: track * SectorsPerTrack + offset within a track.
<P>
 As with other I/O devices, the raw physical disk is an asynchronous device --
 requests to read or write portions of the disk return immediately,
 and an interrupt is invoked later to signal that the operation completed.
<P>
 The physical disk is in fact simulated via operations on a UNIX file.
<P>
 To make life a little more realistic, the simulated time for
 each operation reflects a "track buffer" -- RAM to store the contents
 of the current track as the disk head passes by.  The idea is that the
 disk always transfers to the track buffer, in case that data is requested
 later on.  This has the benefit of eliminating the need for
 "skip-sector" scheduling -- a read request which comes in shortly after
 the head has passed the beginning of the sector can be satisfied more
 quickly, because its contents are in the track buffer.  Most
 disks these days now come with a track buffer.
<P>
 The track buffer simulation can be disabled by compiling with -DNOTRACKBUF
