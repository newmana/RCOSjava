    <TD VALIGN=TOP>
      In order to emulate the hardware, we need to keep track of all
      interrupts the hardware devices would cause, and when they
      are supposed to occur.
<P>
      This module also keeps track of simulated time.  Time advances
      only when the following occur:
      <UL>
        <LI>      interrupts are re-enabled
        <LI>      a user instruction is executed
        <LI>      there is nothing in the ready queue
      </UL>
<P>
      As a result, unlike real hardware, interrupts (and thus time-slice
      context switches) cannot occur anywhere in the code where interrupts
      are enabled, but rather only at those places in the code where
      simulated time advances (so that it becomes time to invoke an
      interrupt in the hardware simulation).
