The RCOS.java application is divided into the following sections
<UL>
  <LI> functional specification
  <LI> specification of <A HREF="#clusters">class clusters</A>
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>
  Functional Specification
</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Functional specification is list of capabilities of RCOS.java
</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <B> Hardware </B>
    <UL>
      <LI> simulated CPU is pcode machine with additions for interrupt
           handling (??) and paged memory
      <LI> CPU will carry out obvious steps in instruction execution
           cycle (instruction fetch, instruction execution, check for
           interrupts and handle interrupts)
      <LI> simulated disk is similar to RCOS disk however code will need
           to be modified to stay inline with new interrupt handling 
           mechanism
      <LI> should support multiple disks
      <LI> terminal similar to RCOS including support for multiple terminals
      <LI> size of RAM will need to be increased
      <LI> NetworkCard simulation given time
      <LI> all hardware simulation belongs to a class Machine
    </UL>
      
    <B> Programming Language </B>
    <UL>
      <LI> machine language is Pcode
      <LI> source language will be Pascal (hopefully full version) and
           possibly C++/C subset if appropriate compiler can be found/built
      <LI> some work will need to be done so that code and data (variables and
           stack) are placed into separate pages
      <LI> theoretically possible to provide a compiler that runs from within
           RCOS
      <LI> which implies the need for a shell (and editor??) that runs on RCOS
    </UL>

    <B> Animation/Simulation </B>
    <UL>
      <LI> graphical animation/representation of all OS elements (will include 
           some representation of H/W elements)
      <LI> provide as much direct manipulation as possible
      <LI> ability to single step simulation at individual machine instruction,
           interrupts, OS events, quantum switches through various levels
           up to not at all
      <LI> ability for guided tours implies need to automate setup and running
           of system
      <LI> ability to use components of the animation/OS to demonstrate
           particular algorithms e.g. talking about CPU scheduling it would
           be nice to show just the context switching going on
      <LI> AnimationSupervisor is responsible for upkeep of main screen and
           for delivering messages between the various other animators
    </UL>

    <B> Operating System</B>
    <UL>
      <LI> keep <A HREF="crcnachos/statistics.html">statistics</A> in much the 
           same way as Nachos but provide graphical representation of stats
           for each execution and ways to compare (useful for experiementation)
      <LI> no support for OS threads at this time
      <LI> base MMU is just real memory but support for virtual memory should
           be added real soon, especially using TLB
      <LI> programs will be divided into two regions text and data (including
           both types of data and stack)
      <LI> at a minimum the file system should support the RCOS CP/M like
           file system, but preferably a more complete system that supports
           directory hierarchies should be included
      <LI> have a system call that allows a thread/process to give up CPU
           (useful in testing concurrency problems)
      <LI> simple mechanism for the addition of more system calls, probably
           to hard to do will always require re-compilation of compiler
           and Java
    </UL>
