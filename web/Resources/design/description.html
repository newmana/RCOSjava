  RCOS.java is to be a hypermedia textbook designed to introduce people to
  the the concepts, data structures, algorithms and operation of operating 
  systems.  This is to be achieved through the combination of:
  <UL>
    <LI> a Java applet that works like an operating system and also provides
         animation of the operating system's data structures and algorithms,
    <LI> a collection of hypermedia documents explaining the underlying 
         concepts and theories and linked to the Java applet.
  </UL>
<H3>
  Animated operating system
</H3>
  The animated operating system is based on 
  <A HREF="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/projects/rcos/">RCOS</A>
  and should improve and expand on its capabilities including
  <UL>
    <LI> provide an overview animation that demonstrates all components and
         allows manipulation of the components to read about them, view
         animation of them, modify their behaviour
    <LI> animation of process management, memory management, disk management,
         file management, semaphores and shared memory, terminal I/O, message
         passing between components
    <LI> use of text, animation and audio to indicate important OS events
    <LI> pre-guided tours used to demonstrate particular important concepts
    <LI> experimentation with different algorithms including the ability
         to record history
    <LI> control over the level and speed of animation and operation
    <LI> ability to compile and execute PLL/2 programs on-line
    <LI> a small C-like language to compliment/replace PLL/2 (a C to Pascal
         translator??)
    <LI> ability to reproduce performance 
    <LI> immprove on the many short-comings of RCOS
  </UL>
