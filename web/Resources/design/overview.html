RCOS.java is divided into the following sections:
    <UL>
      <LI> simulated <A HREF="#hardware">hardware</A><BR>
           A simulation of the operation of the hardware on which RCOS.java
           executes.
      <LI> <A HREF="#operating system">operating system</A><BR>
           The components that implement the actual operating system.
      <LI> <A HREF="#animation">animation</A><BR>
           The animation of the previous two sections.

      CPU
    </H4>
    Initially, the RCOS.java CPU will be based on the P-Code machine
    used in the original RCOS.  The intention is to reuse the existing RCOS
    PLL compiled code.  The operation of the CPU has been modified slightly
    to support the concept of pages.
    <P>
    The PLL/2 compiler which was included in the original version is being
    replaced by a full C/C++ compiler.  This compiler produces P-Code and
    may be modified from the Java version to compile itself which opens 
    the possibility of being able to compile programs from within RCOS.java.
    <P>
    For the truly keen, it may be possible in the future to use the Java
    Virtual Machine (JVM) as the CPU and the other features of a Java Virtual
    Machine.  This would not only allow people to understand basic concepts
    of OS design but also the workings of the Java Virtual Machine.
    <H4>
      Disk
    </H4>
    The disk sub-system was written by Brett Carter and modified by Andrew Newman.
    <P>
    The disk sub-system is fairly small because of the desire to produce a graphical 
    represenation of the allocation/deallocation of disk blocks by the file system.
    <H4>
      Terminal and Memory (RAM)
    </H4>
    The Terminal provides the physical interface to the user including the keyboard
    and the visual display unit.
    <P>
    Memory consists of two sections.  The first is the CPU cache.  This is
    dynamically adjusted to fit the current program into it.  The main reason
    is to increase speed and reduce complexity.  Secondary RAM holds all
    loaded programs and stores them in two sections: process code and stack.

      Kernel
    </H4>  
    RCOS.java uses a micro-kernel based, message passing structure.  The
    kernel is responsible solely for a number of platform specific functions
    including:
    <UL>
      <LI> handling interrupts,
      <LI> saving/retrieving context, and
      <LI> generating messages to appropriate operating system component
           as a result of system calls
    </UL>

    <H4>
      Message passing
    </H4> 
    Standard operating system functions are divided into a number of components.
    All communication between these components must be in the form of messages.
    All messages pass through the Post Office component that is responsible for
    delivering messages to the correct destinations.
    <P>
    Intention is that theoretically that different components could be
    located on different computers.
    <P>
    The Post Office may also be able to be used to hide the animation from
    the rest of the operating system classes.  All the important OS events
    take the form of messages that pass through the Post Office.
    Rather than litter the implmentation of the OS components with messages
    to the Animator the Post Office has been written automatically to forward
    all messages it receives to the Animator (as well as the actual recipent).
    <P>
    The Animator class can then decide whether or not it wants to do anything
    as a result of the message. 
    
    <H4>
      Other OS Functions
    </H4>
    Remaining operating system responsibilites are divided into seperate
    components (each a Java class in RCOS.java) including:
    <UL>
      <LI> <B>Disk Scheduler</B><BR>
           Responsible for managing disk buffering, scheduling disk requests,
           translating logical block numbers into drive specific sector, 
           cylinder and surface.  There is one Disk Scheduler for each disk.
           Close equivalent to a disk device driver. 
      <LI> <B>File System</B><BR>
           Responsible for implementing a particular file system (MS-DOS, CP/M,
           UNIX, NTFS etc).  Handles standard messages like open file, close file,
           read file, write file, open directory, get file attributes etc.
           It is possible for one RCOS.java instance to have multiple file system
           objects providing the ability to support more than one file system
           at a time.
      <LI> <B>Process Scheduler</B><BR>
           Responsible for managing process creation, termination and scheduling.
           Handles messages such as fork process, exec process, kill process,
           schedule new process, block process, etc.  Maintains all disk queues
           and includes methods such as "running to ready", "running to blocked",
           "get next running process", etc.
      <LI> <B>Memory Manager</B><BR>
           Responsible for managing memory, allocating, deallocating memory
           for processes, reading, writing memory for various other components.
      <LI> <B>Terminals</B><BR>
           Provide mechanism for writing/reading to/from a terminal.
    </UL> 
  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
  <A NAME="animation">
  Animation
</H3>
  The Animation system is hidden from the remainder of the system by
  the Post Office Animator class.  Responsibilities of the animation system includes:
  <UL>
    <LI> drawing the main overview screen,
    <LI> handling input events for this main screen and initiating
         new threads to handle the animation of the various OS components, and
    <LI> deciding which messages are interesting to the animation system
         and distributing them to the approriate threads (if they exist).
