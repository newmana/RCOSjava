    <TD VALIGN=TOP>
   A "Transfer Request" class; being an object created for each quantum
   of disk activity.  It gets posted to the appropriate drive unit and
   enters its FIFO queue.  When actioned, the CpmBdos pointer is used
   to call the member function that knows (via a constant placed in the
   object by the previous member function) which member function to pass
   the object along to next.
 <P> 
  Normally, the  pointer will be a copy of the buffer address in
  the FCB, but making it separate allows the BDOS to present the disk
  driver with the address of its internal buffers without danger of the
  user code accidentally gaining access to them.
 <P> 
   Note: stuff which class  is not concerned with
         is hidden away - including C::tor and D::tor.
