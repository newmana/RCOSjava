    <TD VALIGN=TOP>
   Interface to the file system based on our old friend, the "port".
   Note how each file system operation takes a single XfReq pointer as
   input.  The Single instance of class CpmFs receives requests for
   FS operations from user processes as messages.  It merely creates
   a new XfReq object, filling in the originating PID and FCB pointer,
   determines which disk "unit" the request is for, checks that that
   unit is "on-line" and then calls the appropriate (protected) member
   function.
  <P> 
   ALL calls to the File System result in the caller process
   becomming blocked.  When the FS service is deemed to be complete,
   a result message will be posted to the PID (unblocking it) and the
   XfReq object killed off.  The last member function of CpmBdos to
   be passed the XfReq pointer does this.
 <P> 
   Note: it's each user process's responsibility to ensure the FCB
   is correctly initialised (by a successful call to FsOpen or FsCreat).
   The FS uses these FCB's to retain working data during file I/O
   operations.  Looks to me now (in hindsight) that if you diddle with
   these, and you can trash the file system, big time. Funny, I don't
   recall that ever happening though (?)
