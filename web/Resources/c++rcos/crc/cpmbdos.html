    <TD VALIGN=TOP>
   Here is the actual, re-entrant File System class.  In olden days
   (BC++), we would write this as a set of subroutines with lists and
   arrays to hold dynamic, unit variable data.  To-day, we make it a
   class and instantiate it once for each physical disk configured in.
   A more flexible scheme would have a list of devices rather than a
   simple array (as used in class CpmFs) permitting unlimited, dynamic
   mount and un-mount of devices at run time.
 <P> 
   Once a physical disk is determined to be "on-line" (ie, the host file
   emulating a disk unit, or a real disk unit, even, has started up ok),
   an instance of this class is created giving it the disk characteristics
   and some required file system parameters (number of directory entries,
   block size, etc..).  It is also given the Kernel message dispatcher
   address and the ID of the disk unit it will be responsible for.
 <P> 
   The sequence of events then goes like this:
   <OL>
     <LI> A process invokes an FS operation and is blocked.  This results in
      a message to the CpmFs instance.
     <LI> The  creates an XfReq instance, fills in the FCB and PID
      data from the message, identifies the target unit from the FCB
      (placing a pointer to it in the XfReq), destroys the message and
      calls the appropriate member of the array of the  instances
      with the XfReq pointer.  The  takes no further part in the
      operation.
     <LI>The  instance formulates an appropriate disk transfer
      (track, sector etc) inserting this into the  object along
      with a constant identifying which member function will deal with
      the completed transfer.  It then posts the  to "its" disk
      channel handler.
     <LI> The  arrives at the channel handler and is placed in a FIFO
      queue.  When it finally gets actioned, a result code is placed in
      the  object and the  member of the  instance
      called with the  as parameter via the object pointer.
     <LI> 5. Using the constant placed in the XfReq by the previous member func,
      CpmBdos::NxtFunc passes the XfReq to an internal, private function
      which will do one off:
      <UL>
        <LI> Build a reply message and post it to the PID, then destroy the
          XfReq object.  This completes the cycle, un-blocking the Proc.
        <LI> Alter the XfReq params (eg when a directory block just read
          needs to be re-written) and post to the channel handler again.
        <LI> Spawn another XfReq (as in the case of a read/write operation
          that needs to re-access the directory to fetch the next extent),
          "attaching" the XfReq pointer to the new one, so that operations
          on it can continue after the intermediate operation has finished.
          This allows infinite (!?) nesting of channel calls. 
     </UL>
    <LI> A message arrives back at the originating process with the result
      of the requested operation, effectively un-blocking it to continue
      processing as dictated by internal logic.  The FCB it passed in the
      first place has been updated and data transfered to/from the buffer
      set in the FCB.  Simple, right?
