The following is an extract from "OSBORNE USER'S GUIDE, Applications And
Programming" by Steven M. Zimmerman et al, Copyright &copy; 1983 by Robert
J. Brady Company.&nbsp; This is included to provide perspective on the
system implemented by RCOS.java and a historical view of platform independent
programming.
<H3>
THE p-System FOR DOUBLE DENSITY</H3>
Osborne Computer Corporation has been a leader in using industrial standard
operating systems and formats whenever available and possible. The discussion
above on how the OSBORNE 1 has been designed to read diskettes from other
computers is evidence of this effort. The operating systems selected for
the double density environment include both CP/M and the p-System. CP/M
has been discussed in detail earlier in this book.

<P>The p-System is an attempt to develop an operating system which will
produce a diskette which is interchangeable, or transportable from computer
to computer. The p-System was developed at the University of California
at San Diego and has the following features:
<UL>
<LI>
The language compiles a "p-code" which is portable and machine independent.</LI>

<LI>
It is a good environment for writing programs.</LI>

<LI>
A code generator is available to convert p-code to machine level code.</LI>

<LI>
The system aids in structuring programs.</LI>

<LI>
Relatively good documentation is available.</LI>
</UL>
The p-System not only runs on microcomputers, but also on mini-computers
and some main-frame computers. Osborne and IBM are supporting a common
format called Universal Medium for transferring programs between computers
manufactured by different companies through the p-System.

<P>SoftTech Microsystems of San Diego, known for their work with compilers
for the IBM PC, have secured the manufacturing license from the University
of California at San Diego (UCSD) and have in turn licensed it to Osborne
Computer Corporation. While other computer manufacturers are using the
p-System, they are not necessarily compatible, until they all adopt the
Universal Medium format. The p-System is user friendly, displaying a menu
or option available instead of the CP/M A>. Plain English is used to tell
you what problems are instead of the familiar error code of CP/M "BDOS
ERROR...".

<P>When released to all purchasers on record of double density computers
or upgrades, the p-System release will be the Run-Time system. It will
run programs, copy diskettes, transfer files, delete files, examine directories,
and perform other operating system functions. It will be provided to all
OSBORNE 1-double density owners on record, at cost to them.

<P>The development system superset will be offered for purchase later,
under the Osborne Approved Software offerings. It includes all the Run-Time
system features, plus an editor, an assembler, a Pascal language compiler
and a debugger. Later offerings will include SoftTech's FORTRAN and BASIC
compilers for the p-System.
