One of the first attempts to provide a truely platform independent programming
language came with the introduction of Pascal and the p-Machine.&nbsp;
A Pascal-P compiler would generate an intermediate code called P-Code.&nbsp;&nbsp;
P-Code is the native assembly language of a hypothetical, stack machine,
called the P-Machine.&nbsp; The origins of this instruction set is said
to be from the Burrough Large System.&nbsp; Each new system could simply
implement the P-Machine and run any P-Code.

<P>The term was first used in "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs",
N. Wirth, P-H 1976.&nbsp; Byte articles on writing a Pascal Compiler in
Northstar BASIC (August, 1978) is the basis of the RCOS implementation.&nbsp;
Additions of the basic specification were made to accomodate RCOS specific
features such as reading and writing of files, shared memory, and semaphores.

<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~rhyde/psource.htm">p-Source</A> and
the <A HREF="osborne.html">Osborne User's Guide</A> are two of the many
books written at the time to support the growing number of home and business
computers running P-Code based systems: including TRS-80, Apple II, Osborne
1, CoCo 3, etc.

<P>This idea of compiler design, where there is a step between compilation
and generating machine specific code, is still used today.&nbsp; Apart
from the obvious (Java), it is used in products such as Power Builder,
Visual Basic and Delphi.
