  RCOSjava is a tool designed to help people understand the inner workings
  of an operating system.  It began in 1996 by four people at Central
  Queensland University.  RCOSjava is an animated, multi-tasking 
  operating system running on simulated hardware.  It is based on
  the P-Machine, a simple hypothetical computer system.  It includes
  a C/C++ compiler that generates P-Code to be executed by the P-Machine.
  <P>
  RCOSjava is designed to demonstrate general operating system principles 
  through controlled animation, in the Java programming language.  RCOSjava
  is implemented in Java using good code design.  This
  allows students to modify, experiment with and compare different data
  structures and algorithms.
  <P>
  RCOSjava is based on 
  <A HREF="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/Projects/rcos/" TARGET="body">RCOS</A>,
  an earlier C++ based system.
  <P>
  If you have any contributions or wish to let us know how RCOSjava is being
  used please send an <A HREF="mailto:andrewfnewman@netscape.net">email</A>.
