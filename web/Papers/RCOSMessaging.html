The Original Messaging System</h2>
Outline original C++ version and its conversion to Java.
<p>Outline of C++ system.
<p>The conversion to Java lead to a very procedural based solution.&nbsp;
This was due to it being derived from the C++ system and the lack of knowledge
in how to produce object orientated based system.
<p>Initially any object that implemented "SimpleMessageHandler" would register
to a given post office.&nbsp; The job of the post office was to record
the registered objects and send the messages to the registered objects.
<p>The system relied upon the base object type "Message".&nbsp; This object
contained a Source, Destination, Type and Body.&nbsp; The first three were
strings and the body an Object.&nbsp; The post office object would use
the destination to parse the send object to the appropriate registered
object.&nbsp; The type attributed would be used by the receiving object
to determine whether it handled it or not.&nbsp; The body was used to store
any primitive (in their object form) or complex data types.
<p>The system relied upon the following common methods:
<br>sendMessage(Message) - The message is sent to the Post Office.
<br>receiveMessage(Message) - Checks to determine whether the object is
valid and passes it (if okay) to ProcessMessage.
<br>processMessage(Message) - In a series of if-then-else statements it
checks to see what type the message and proceeds to do some action if it
matches.
<h2>
Improving the Messaging System</h2>
A new system was considered in order to provide a more object orientated
approach to achieve messaging.&nbsp; The criteria of the messaging system
was that it must increase the readability and maintability of the system
while encouraging code reuse.&nbsp; In this was it was decided that a distinction
between messages being sent be enhanced.&nbsp; Two distinct post offices
were created for the Operating System and for the Animator Office.&nbsp;
The mimiced the distinction made already within the system.&nbsp; For simplicity
the operating system and animator components know only of their post office
and the components connected to them.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
MessageSystem</h3>
The messaging system divided all messages into three categories:
<ul>
<li>
Animator – Messages for animator components only,</li>

<li>
OS – Messages for operating system components only, and</li>

<li>
Universal – Message destined for all messaging sub-systems.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Visitor Pattern</h3>
One of the important effects of the Visitor pattern used in RCOS.java is
the ability to arbitrarily add functionality to object without modification
of them.&nbsp; This simplifies the introduction of extending RCOS.java
functionality.&nbsp; This technique is known as “double dispatch”.&nbsp;
However, Java is a “single dispatch language” in that the method executed
is based on the type of the received object.
<p>The benefits of this pattern are:
<br>1/ Reduction in the amount of code by removing many long and complicated
if-then-else statements.&nbsp; The determining factor of whether an object
processes a message is not based on arbitrary conditions.
<br>2/ Coherence within a particular message object.&nbsp; The code for
each message is contained inside the appropriate message.
<br>3/ Complicated objects or primitive data types can be used inside the
object without casting or creating ad hoc external objects.
<br>4/ New messages do not require new code to be added to handle the message;
rather the message is modified instead.
<br>5/ The determining factor of whether a message was handled was based
on arbitrary conditions.
<br>6/ Increased encapsulation of data and implementation hiding.
<p>When the visitor pattern was implemented a simplified the process message
to a few lines of code for each receiver.&nbsp; The message object interface
to outside code became well defined, attributes were kept encapsulated
and access was allowed via methods.
<p>Related to the MVC Pattern is double dispatch.
<h3>
Adapter Pattern</h3>
The messages are broken up into three destination categories:
<ul>
<li>
OS only,</li>

<li>
Animator only, and</li>

<li>
Universal (all destinations).</li>
</ul>

<p><br>Now there are adapters of the abstract classes.&nbsp; Each abstract
class contains a “doMessage” for each possible receiving class.&nbsp; The
adapter class implements the respective abstract class with empty methods.&nbsp;
Each message then extends the adapter class and overrides only the necessary
methods.
<h3>
Command Pattern</h3>
A useful pattern to overcome the problem of invoking arbitrary methods
in an object is the Command pattern.&nbsp; This is essential in allowing
the interface to allow undoable operations.&nbsp; This is an important
principle of user interface design especially in an educational environment
[impressive link here].
<p>Each command in the RCOS.java system is decoupled i.e. the button pressed
invokes a messaging object that performs the task rather than performing
the task directly.&nbsp; This enables object performing the task to save
any relevant information before executing so that it may be undone at any
time.&nbsp; Meanwhile a listener object records all of the operations that
have occurred.
<p>In RCOS you have a Message Object:
<br>doMessage(receiver type) – stores state and carries out some operation
based on receiver type.
<br>undoMessage(receiver type) – undoes operation based on receiver type.
<br>boolean undoableMessage(receiver type) – returns true of false if message
can or can't be undone.
<p>Post Office Object:
<br>Vector vMessages – Vector of messages which can be undone.
<br>sendMessage() – sends message to all Post Offices.
<br>localSendMessage() – sends message to local objects listening.
<br>undoMessage() – sends an undo message to all listeners.
<br>processMessage() - proceeds to create a new message object based on
it's type and executes the method "doMessage" passing itself.
<h3>
Model-View-Controller Pattern</h3>
The Model-View-Controller design pattern originated in Smalltalk and specifically
use in user interface design [Gamma et al 1995].&nbsp; It's probably most
used in Java in creating user interfaces, too.&nbsp; The purpose of the
MVC architecture is to separate the user interface from the underlying
application (model).&nbsp; The user interface is split up into the view
(output) and the control (user input).&nbsp; The model should be self-contained
and free of external requirements of the user interface.
<p>This is implemented to ensure that:
<ul>
<li>
the application code is reusable,</li>

<li>
the user interface or application can be developed independent of one another,
and</li>

<li>
the system code can remain as modular as possible with classes able to
inherit code.</li>
</ul>
The initial development of RCOS.java consisted of one programmer working
on the user interface while the others worked on components of the operation
system (message passing, file system, CPU, etc.).&nbsp; This ensured that
the animation was dependant only on predefined messages it would receive
from the operating system.
<p>By design RCOS.java has a large hierarchy of class files.&nbsp; The
Animator package is split by operating system components i.e. Animator.CPU,
Animator.Disk, etc.
<p>Operating system, animators and universal sections divide the messaging
system.&nbsp; The operating system and animation sub-systems have their
own post office designed to send message to each other and to registered
components within the designated area.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Advantages over old messaging system</h2>
Reduction in and elimination of overlapping the usage of certain messages.&nbsp;
In the new message system, each message object clearly defines who receives
the message and what data objects it contains.&nbsp; This lead to removal
of several unneeded messages (due to overlapping with other messages) and
data objects.&nbsp; There was also the case where objects (especially animators)
would explicity determine which object was sending the message in order
to process the message or not.&nbsp; This indicated that there were messages
that were being used for two or more purposes.&nbsp; These were also eliminated.
<p>As this is a new system the extensibility of the system has yet to be
fully tested.&nbsp; However, one of the advantages foreseen with the new
system is in the case of maintenance.&nbsp; The addition of new messages,
that use the existing functionality of the system, requires only creation
of just a new message object. The removal of a messages is equally simple.
<p>This commensurate effort did not exist in the old system.&nbsp; It was
possible to remove the sending of an old message and it's object constructors.&nbsp;
Yet the removal of receiving the retired message could be left intact,
was difficult to track and had no negative impact.&nbsp; This could lead
to confusion and code bloat over a long periods of modification.&nbsp;
In fact, it existed in the old system already in the "CPUAnimator" expecting
to receive a "UpdateInstruction" message that never came.&nbsp; This was
retained in the system, over many changes, until the new messaging system
was implemented.
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Ownership of messages is made easier for two reasons:</font>
<ul>
<li>
All the receiving objects are explicit in the message object and</li>

<li>
All sending objects implicitly import them.</li>
</ul>
This contrasts with the old system where messages could be created by simply
constructing a message object with different "String" parameter.&nbsp;
This ad hoc manner of message creation meant that there was no real way
to easily examine the source code to determine what message existed, who
would be sending and what were the receiving objects.&nbsp; There were
several instances where the senders and receivers ID was incorrect or simply
made up.
<p>The new system design removed the ability to define the identification
of the receiving and sending objects when a message object is intiatited.&nbsp;
Indeed, there is no way when creating a message to explicitly define a
receiving object.&nbsp; This change is important because receiving objects
could change over time.&nbsp; By sending it to those all objects that have
registered to the post office it enables the message object itself to contain
who receives it.&nbsp; The sending object is nolonger string based but
a message handler.&nbsp; Which should at least reduce the ability to create
ad hoc senders.&nbsp; In normal usage an object sending it would pass itself.
<p>The original message object had only one message container object (Object)
that was then cast to the required type e.g. Integer, RCOS defined object
like RCOSProcess, etc.&nbsp; Instead each object now contains the required
content type(s).&nbsp; Creation of object containers of primitive types
(like integers and bytes) before a message is sent has been removed.&nbsp;
There is also no casting is needed to process the message.&nbsp; The cost
of this is that a message object is created each time when they are received
by an object to be processed.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has the benefit however, that
allows multiple complex data objects to be internally constructured for
message transport.&nbsp; Instead of creating external objects for one off
messages or sending multiple messages with different names (like UpdateFileList
and UpdateDirectoryList) in order to get many complicated data structures
returned.
<p>The removal of the code blocks within the series of if-then-else and
moving them to separate methods led to a greater formalisation of what
each object within the system was to perform.&nbsp; Also, the appearance
of common methods and data structures lead to the improvement of code reuse.&nbsp;
Similar sections of code that were used to process two or three messages
were converted into methods for reuse.&nbsp; Where appropriate these were
made publicly or privately accessible.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Improvements</h2>
The use of inheritance or composition rather than a flat message objects.&nbsp;
Currently, the system has separate messages for each task, whether or not
their are similar messages with similar tasks.&nbsp; Messages that use
system objects (like RCOSProcess) use composition to achieve similar tasks
within different messages.&nbsp; Further aggregation of common objects
passed inside messages and further sorting of messages into packages based
on sender or sendee would increase reusability.&nbsp; An example might
be taking the read and write memory messages.&nbsp; These are currently
divided by reading by pages and reading by bytes.&nbsp; A simpler "readMemory"
and "writeMemory" could combine their functionality.
<p>Implementing of the Visitor pattern to other areas of RCOS.java.&nbsp;
Such as the CPU and Kernel.
<p>String to Int and Ints to Strings
