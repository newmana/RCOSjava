   <b>Goals for RCOSjava Version 1.0:</b>   
<ul>
     
  <li> written in Java 1.3 code only, </li>
  <li> run multiple programs at the same time (multi-task), </li>
  <li> support the use of semaphores and share memory in programs (IPC), 
   </li>
  <li> support programs that use file I/O (File Manager, Disk Scheduler), 
    </li>
  <li> be written in good object orientated code (paper to come), </li>
  <li> provide animation of files system data structures, disk allocation, 
       shared memory, semaphores, memory management, terminal
       allocation and process scheduling, </li>
  <li> compile C/C++ code into P-Code, </li>
  <li> provide the ability to implement interactive, guided introductions 
       to operating system concepts (recorder/playback), and </li>
  <li> be fully documented and integrated into a web site.</li>
</ul>

This is just a quick update to make it known that development has been
proceeding in fits and starts with a recent 3-4 days of solid development
on the compiler taking place.  I'm currently pretty busy but the compiler
and a new release of RCOSjava should happen soon.
</p>
<p><b>15th August, 2001</b></p>
<p>
Alpha 3-2 is Alpha 3 with the instructions updated and the fix applied for
the threading issues (which means it's more stable and faster).  
</p>
<p><b>3rd July, 2001</b></p>
<p>
Alpha 3-1 is Alpha 3 with improved instructions, Soma web server and fixes
to the shell scripts for Unix so they don't have line feeds.
</p>
<p><b>13th June, 2001</b></p>
<p>
I decided to release the current state of the code as Alpha 3.&nbsp; This
means that most of the bugs found in Alpha 2 are now fixed.&nbsp;  However, I
didn't get a chance to finish the compiler.  So that will be in Alpha 4 along
with shared memory.  It means that there will be an Alpha 5 with
the disk stuff in it and the help system.&nbsp; You can download Alpha 3 from
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/rcosjava/RCOSjavaAlpha3.zip">here</A>.
</p>
<p><b>3rd June, 2001</b></p>
<p>
After many weeks of not having a chance to do any development, I'm finally
back into it.&nbsp; The features listed below should be available by June 11th.
&nbsp;Note: It will be a C compiler not a C/C++ compiler.
</p>
<p><b>26th April, 2001</b></p>
<p>The <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/rcosjava/RCOSjavaAlpha2.zip">
second alpha</a> is out now.&nbsp; Many bugs causing stability issues have
been resolved.&nbsp; The IPC Manager is now enabled and debugged.&nbsp; Shared
memory has been delayed until some demonstration code is available.&nbsp;
The "Step" and "Kill" functionaility in the Process Manager now functions
correctly.&nbsp; The next alpha is planned for two to three weeks and will
include: changing process priority, C/C++ compiler, shared memory, documentation
and help system. </p>
<p><b>15th April, 2001</b>   </p>
<p> The first alpha release is now <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/rcosjava/RCOSjavaAlpha1.zip">
available</a>.&nbsp; This includes the Ant build script, scheduler with
FIFO, LIFO and Priority queueing, the recording/playback and better
documentation.&nbsp; Bugs that have been discovered are in the bug tracking
system.&nbsp; Fixes to these bugs and a properly working IPC Manager will
be in the next release, hopefully a week or so away.&nbsp; Any feedback
would be appreciated. &nbsp;
</p>
<b>2nd March, 2001</b>   
<p>RCOSjava has undergone more development recently.  A concerted effort
to finish development is being made.&nbsp; Currently, the system is
semi-functional although some major work (mainly reintergration of
broken code) is still needed.&nbsp; The recording is also in place.&nbsp;
However, it is significenlty slow and still a little buggy.  The UI is yet
to be complete.&nbsp; There is also a basic Ant build script in place.
The JUnit tests are yet to be integrated.&nbsp; All Java (with the
exception of KOML) is now JDK 1.3 compliant.
