   <b>Goals for RCOSjava Version 1.0:</b>   
<ul>
  <li> written in Java 1.3 code only, </li>
  <li> run multiple programs at the same time (multi-task), </li>
  <li> support the use of semaphores and share memory in programs (IPC), 
   </li>
  <li> support programs that use file I/O (File Manager, Disk Scheduler), 
    </li>
  <li> be written in good object  code (paper to come), </li>
  <li> provide animation of files system data structures, disk allocation, 
       shared memory, semaphores, memory management, terminal
       allocation and process scheduling, </li>
  <li> compile C code into P-Code, </li>
  <li> provide the ability to implement interactive, guided introductions 
       to operating system concepts (recorder/playback), and </li>
  <li> be fully documented and integrated into a web site.</li>
</ul>

The Multimedia Animator continues to progress to completion.  I have
checked a version that works for only the Terminal Manager and Terminal 
Manager Animator.  The rest should be straight forward.
</p>
<p><b>9th November, 2002</b></p>
<p>
I've just started changing some stuff again.  The IPC Manager needed some
serious work to get it up to scratch.  The only things left to do on the
conversion is the Help and Multimedia playback/recording.  Here's another
screenshot of the IPC Manager running the shared memory program.<BR>

<p>
I'm nearly finished the conversion of the existing functionality of RCOSjava 
to Swing.  I've done a quick screen shot in OS X to show what it's like.<BR>

</p>
<p><b>17th July, 2002</b></p>
<p>
I've started work on the last major release before I intend to stop development
here and go into maintenance/support mode.  There will also be further
documentation produced including finishing the paper on the messagin system.
</p>
I plan to release version 0.5 with a Swing UI, finished C compiler and fully 
functional recording and playback.  All currently known bugs will also be
fixed.
</p>
<p><b>26th May, 2002</b></p>
<p>
I've fixed the problems with examples 3 and 4.  I've added while loops and 
fixed a problem with for loop compilation.  Shared memory now actually 
creates memory using the memory manager rather than an internal, hidden object.
I spent sometime making sure the distributions were correct and as small as
possible.
</p>
<p><b>28th April, 2002</b></p>
<p>
It's here at last.  I've called it RCOSjava 0.4 as I figure there's at least
6 version to go.  The compiler compiles the current source code with exception to
the ones using arrays (3 and 4).  Arrays were like the second thing I got
going so I'll have to track that down now next.  The IPC Animator is now
complete although I will probably modify how the shared memory stuff is
displayed.  I plan to try and get two more released by the start of July.
</p>
<p><b>14th April, 2002</b></p>
<p>
I have checked into CVS the latest compiler which successfully compiles all
the example .c files.  The .c files includes examples for if-then, 
semaphores and other simple stuff.  I will finish off shared memory,
get the IPC animator done, some clean-up and then do a release.
</p>
<p><b>11th January, 2002</b></p>
<p>
This is just a quick update to make it known that development has been
proceeding in fits and starts with a recent 3-4 days of solid development
on the compiler taking place.  I'm currently pretty busy but the compiler
and a new release of RCOSjava should happen soon.
</p>
<p><b>15th August, 2001</b></p>
<p>
Alpha 3-2 is Alpha 3 with the instructions updated and the fix applied for
the threading issues (which means it's more stable and faster).  
</p>
<p><b>3rd July, 2001</b></p>
<p>
Alpha 3-1 is Alpha 3 with improved instructions, Soma web server and fixes
to the shell scripts for Unix so they don't have line feeds.
</p>
<p><b>13th June, 2001</b></p>
<p>
I decided to release the current state of the code as Alpha 3.&nbsp; This
means that most of the bugs found in Alpha 2 are now fixed.&nbsp;  However, I
didn't get a chance to finish the compiler.  So that will be in Alpha 4 along
with shared memory.  It means that there will be an Alpha 5 with
the disk stuff in it and the help system.&nbsp; You can download Alpha 3 from
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/rcosjava/RCOSjavaAlpha3.zip">here</A>.
</p>
<p><b>3rd June, 2001</b></p>
<p>
After many weeks of not having a chance to do any development, I'm finally
back into it.&nbsp; The features listed below should be available by June 11th.
&nbsp;Note: It will be a C compiler not a C/C++ compiler.
</p>
<p><b>26th April, 2001</b></p>
<p>The <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/rcosjava/RCOSjavaAlpha2.zip">
second alpha</a> is out now.&nbsp; Many bugs causing stability issues have
been resolved.&nbsp; The IPC Manager is now enabled and debugged.&nbsp; Shared
memory has been delayed until some demonstration code is available.&nbsp;
The "Step" and "Kill" functionality in the Process Manager now functions
correctly.&nbsp; The next alpha is planned for two to three weeks and will
include: changing process priority, C/C++ compiler, shared memory, documentation
and help system. </p>
<p><b>15th April, 2001</b>   </p>
<p> The first alpha release is now <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/rcosjava/RCOSjavaAlpha1.zip">
available</a>.&nbsp; This includes the Ant build script, scheduler with
FIFO, LIFO and Priority queuing, the recording/playback and better
documentation.&nbsp; Bugs that have been discovered are in the bug tracking
system.&nbsp; Fixes to these bugs and a properly working IPC Manager will
be in the next release, hopefully a week or so away.&nbsp; Any feedback
would be appreciated. &nbsp;
</p>
<b>2nd March, 2001</b>   
<p>RCOSjava has undergone more development recently.  A concerted effort
to finish development is being made.&nbsp; Currently, the system is
semi-functional although some major work (mainly reintegration of
broken code) is still needed.&nbsp; The recording is also in place.&nbsp;
However, it is significantly slow and still a little buggy.  The UI is yet
to be complete.&nbsp; There is also a basic Ant build script in place.
The JUnit tests are yet to be integrated.&nbsp; All Java (with the
exception of KOML) is now JDK 1.3 compliant.
